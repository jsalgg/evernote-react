A simple Evernote clone focused on decluttering your life and helping you stay on track.

This app has a niche! That niche is food! Write your daily food logs for health, dieting, and any other food needs!

Foot-Note-Node is the Heroku domain, but it should hve been Food-note-node. That was my mistake.
